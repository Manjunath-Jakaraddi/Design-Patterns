States that: Talk only to your immediate friends

public float getTemp() {
    return station.getThermometer().getTemperature();
}
Here not the current method need not know about the new Object Temperatur being returned by (station.getThermometer())

Which all objects methods it is ok to access
1. The Object itself
2. Objects passed as parameters to the methods
3. Object that is instantiated within the method
4. The composed objects in the class.

public class Car {
    Engine engine; // we can access this objects methods

    public Car() {}

    public void start(Key key) {  // can access key objects methods
        Doors doors = new Doors();  // can access doors objects methods
        updateDisplay(); // can access this objects methods
        key.getLeftButton().click(); // not allowed as this method should not have know ledge of button objects
        key.clickLeftButton(); // can be handled by exposing method which does the same without accessing the object
    }

    public void updateDisplay() {

    }
}
