/**
 * The difference between decorators and adapter is the intent
 * adapter convert the interface and make it easier to consume for the client
 * whereas the decorater enables to add new behaviour and does change any interface(maintains the same interface)
 * Adapter -> Converts one interface to another
 * Decorator -> Doesnâ€™t alter the interface, but adds responsibility
 * Facade -> Makes an interface simpler (when subsystem is very complex it exposes a simplified interface as per clients requirements)
 *          It also enables decoupling from subsystem if a new device is bought can be easily replaced in subsytem and still works the same
